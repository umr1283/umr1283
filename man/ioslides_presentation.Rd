}
\arguments{
\item{logo}{Path to file that includes a logo for use in the presentation
(should be square and at least 128x128).}

\item{slide_level}{Header level to consider as slide separator (Defaults to
header 2).}

\item{incremental}{\code{TRUE} to render slide bullets incrementally.
Note that if you want to reverse the default incremental behavior for an
individual bullet you can preceded it with \code{>}.
For example: \emph{\code{> - Bullet Text}}.}

\item{fig_width}{Default width (in inches) for figures}

\item{fig_height}{Default height (in inches) for figures}

\item{fig_retina}{Scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2, which
currently works for all widely used retina displays). Set to \code{NULL} to
prevent retina scaling. Note that this will always be \code{NULL} when
\code{keep_md} is specified (this is because \code{fig_retina} relies on
outputting HTML directly into the markdown document).}

\item{fig_caption}{\code{TRUE} to render figures with captions}

\item{dev}{Graphics device to use for figure output (defaults to png)}

\item{df_print}{Method to be used for printing data frames. Valid values
include "default", "kable", "tibble", and "paged". The "default" method
uses a corresponding S3 method of \code{print}, typically
\code{print.data.frame}. The "kable" method uses the
\code{\link[knitr:kable]{knitr::kable}} function. The "tibble" method uses
the \pkg{tibble} package to print a summary of the data frame. The "paged"
method creates a paginated HTML table (note that this method is only valid
for formats that produce HTML). In addition to the named methods you can
also pass an arbitrary function to be used for printing data frames. You
can disable the \code{df_print} behavior entirely by setting the option
\code{rmarkdown.df_print} to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{smart}{Produce typographically correct output, converting straight
quotes to curly quotes, \code{---} to em-dashes, \code{--} to en-dashes, and
\code{...} to ellipses.}

\item{self_contained}{Produce a standalone HTML file with no external
dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked
scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. Note that even for self contained
documents MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of
its size).}

\item{widescreen}{Display presentation with wider dimensions.}

\item{smaller}{Use smaller text on all slides. You can also enable this for
individual slides by adding the \code{.smaller} attribute to the slide
header (see \emph{Presentation Size} below for details).}

\item{transition}{Speed of slide transitions. This can be "default",
"slower", "faster", or a numeric value with a number of seconds (e.g. 0.5).}

\item{mathjax}{Include mathjax. The "default" option uses an https URL from a
MathJax CDN. The "local" option uses a local version of MathJax (which is
copied into the output directory). You can pass an alternate URL or pass
\code{NULL} to exclude MathJax entirely.}

\item{analytics}{A Google analytics property ID.}

\item{template}{Pandoc template to use for rendering. Pass "default" to use
the rmarkdown package default template; pass \code{NULL} to use pandoc's
built-in template; pass a path to use a custom template that you've created.
Note that if you don't use the "default" template then some features of
\code{html_document} won't be available (see the Templates section below for
more details).}

\item{css}{One or more css files to include}

\item{includes}{Named list of additional content to include within the
document (typically created using the \code{\link[rmarkdown]{includes}} function).}

\item{keep_md}{Keep the markdown file generated by knitting.}

\item{lib_dir}{Directory to copy dependent HTML libraries (e.g. jquery,
bootstrap, etc.) into. By default this will be the name of the document with
\code{_files} appended to it.}

\item{md_extensions}{Markdown extensions to be added or removed from the
default definition or R Markdown. See the \code{\link[rmarkdown]{rmarkdown_format}} for
additional details.}

\item{pandoc_args}{Additional command line options to pass to pandoc}

\item{extra_dependencies}{Additional function arguments to pass to the
base R Markdown HTML output formatter \code{\link[rmarkdown]{html_document_base}}}

\item{csl}{bibliography style as a csl file.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to a specific output format function `rmarkdown::ioslides_presentation`}
}
\value{
R Markdown output format to pass to render
}
\description{
Format for converting from R Markdown to an [ioslides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/) presentation.
}

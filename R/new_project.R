# This function showcases how one might write a function to be used as an
# RStudio project template. This function will be called when the user invokes
# the New Project wizard using the project template defined in the template file
# at:
#
#   inst/rstudio/templates/project/hello_world.dcf
#
# The function itself just echos its inputs and outputs to a file called INDEX,
# which is then opened by RStudio when the new project is opened.
